# Introduction

## Background

Neurodevelopmental disorders are persistent and impairing lifelong conditions resulting from combined genetic and environmental influences [@faraone2021]. \acr{ADHD} is a highly heritable [@pettersson2019] neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosed in approximately 8% of children and youth worldwide [@ayano2023] and is characterized by persistent inattention and/or hyperactivity symptoms causing impairment in multiple settings [@americanpsychiatricassociation2022]. Both \acr{ADHD} and autism are associated with a range of challenges including difficulties with academic achievement, peer relationships, and behaviour regulation [@french2024; @posar2019]. Interventions for \acr{ADHD} include use of stimulant or non-stimulant medications, behavioural parent training, and environmental accommodations [@faraone2021]. Although each of these may result in improvements at the group level, benefits are generally time limited and impairment remains in many individuals [@faraone2021]. 

## Aim

Computerized \acr{EF} training programs have shown consistent growth in development and investigation, with several commercial options currently available. The existing research on efficacy of these programs is variable and largely shows a lack of far transfer to untrained skills. Most videogame-based \acr{EF} training programs in neurodevelopmental disorders have focused on ADHD, with more recent work exploring applications in autism. However, both disorders are characterized by high heterogeneity in clinical and \acr{EF} characteristics pointing to potential key factors that may be associated with variability in response to \acr{EF} training. There has been limited investigation on factors associated with heterogeneity in responses to treatment, which is essential to understand what intervention works best for whom. To address gaps in the research on currently available \acr{EF} training programs, our team co-created Mega Team with youth co-designers with a focus on accessibility, affordability, and multi-skill training. Overall results of the main \acr{RCT} show near and far transfer in ADHD participants but not in autistic participants [@cheungRCT]. This project will explore a broad range of baseline predictors to better understand patterns in individual factors of response to computerized \acr{EF} training in a sample of ADHD and/or autism children.

**Research Question:** Do demographic (age and gender), clinical (use of stimulant medication, ADHD symptoms, autism traits), \acr{EF} (response inhibition, working memory baseline performance, and EF-related impairment), and training (time on task) factors predict magnitude of response to treatment in near and far transfer (near: response inhibition and working memory; far: ADHD symptoms, daily \acr{EF} impairment, planning, and fluency) outcome measures immediately after Mega Team training and at six month follow-up in ADHD children and autistic children?
