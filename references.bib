  abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) co-occurs with many other psychiatric disorders and traits. In this review, we summarize and interpret the existing literature on the genetic architecture of these comorbidities based on hypothesis-generating approaches. Quantitative genetic studies indicate that genetic factors play a substantial role in the observed co-occurrence of ADHD with many different disorders and traits. Molecular genetic correlations derived from genome-wide association studies and results of studies based on polygenic risk scores confirm the general pattern but provide effect estimates that are smaller than those from twin studies. The identification of the specific genetic variants and biological pathways underlying co-occurrence using genome-wide approaches is still in its infancy. The first analyses of causal inference using genetic data support causal relationships between ADHD and comorbid disorders, although bidirectional effects identified in some instances point to complex relationships. While several issues in the methodology and inferences from the results are still to be overcome, this review shows that the co-occurrence of ADHD with many psychiatric disorders and traits is genetically interpretable.},

METHODS: Peer-reviewed articles comparing ASD, ADHD, and typically developing individuals under 19 years of age were identified. The domains evaluated were: working memory, response inhibition, planning, cognitive flexibility, attention, processing speed, and visuospatial abilities. RESULTS: Fifty-eight articles met inclusion criteria. Analyses were performed on 45 performance metrics from 24 individual tasks. No differences in EF were found between individuals diagnosed with ASD and ADHD. Individuals diagnosed with ASD and ADHD exhibited worse performance in attention, flexibility, visuospatial abilities, working memory, processing speed, and response inhibition than typically developing individuals. Groups did not differ in planning abilities. CONCLUSION: Children and adolescents with ASD and ADHD have similar EF profiles. Further research is needed to determine if comorbidity accounts for the commonality in executive dysfunction between each disorder.},
