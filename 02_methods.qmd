# Methods

## Participants

<!-- paragraph with cross referenced table and citations included -->

Children aged 6-12 years old with a diagnosis of ADHD (n = 186) or autism (n = 67) were randomized in the study (see @tbl-demo). Children on medication were included if they were on a stable dose for the preceding month before training and not concurrently participating in a medication trial. Participants had a diagnosis of ADHD or autism with or without co-occurring ADHD. All other comorbidities were included in both participant groups. Overall inclusion criteria were: (a) 6 to 12 years old; (b) Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (FSIQ) \> 70 on a standardized norm-referenced IQ measure; (c) reliable access to the internet; (d) either diagnosed with ADHD based on Diagnostic Statistical Manual fifth edition [@americanpsychiatricassociation2022] criteria confirmed by responses on the Parent Interview for Child Symptoms (PICS) [@ickowicz2006] or diagnosed with ASD based on the DSM-5 criteria confirmed by ratings on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule – Second Edition (ADOS-2) [@lord2012].

## Measures

**Stop Signal Task**: The Stop Signal Task measures response inhibition [@logan1997]. This computerized task is composed of one practice block and four assessment blocks which contain 24 trials each. Participants were instructed to make a speeded response to either the X or O stimulus on the screen and withhold their response if the stimulus was preceded by a beep. The Stop Signal Task is made up of go trials and stop trials. Go trials are trials when the participant is expected to make a speeded response. Stop trials are trials when a stop signal (e.g. auditory tone) is presented, and participants are expected to withhold their speeded response. The percentage of stop trials a participant successfully inhibits their response on is referred to as the percent stop inhibition (PSI) and is used in determining validity of administration. **Stop signal reaction time (SSRT)** was calculated as an estimate of the participants’ response inhibition in milliseconds – a faster SSRT indicates better response inhibition. This task was administered at all three assessment visits. 

<!-- cross referenced appendix in this paragraph --> 
**Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire, fourth edition (SNAP-IV)**: The SNAP-IV; [@swanson1981] measures ADHD symptoms. Caregivers rated their child’s behaviours on a 4-point Likert scale from “not at all” to “very much” on 26 statements describing inattention (9 items), hyperactivity/impulsivity (9 items), and oppositional (8 items) behaviours. The **SNAP total sum** reflects the number and severity of symptoms, with higher scores reflecting greater ADHD symptoms. The SNAP-IV shows acceptable internal consistency and demonstrates parent scores predictive of an ADHD diagnosis for scores above 1.8 on inattention and above 2.4 for hyperactivity/impulsivity [@bussing2008]. The SNAP-IV was administered at baseline, 5 weeks post treatment, and at 6 month follow-up. See [@sec-apx1] for complete measure.

## Procedure

The current analysis was part of an RCT examining the efficacy of Mega Team training in ADHD children and youth and in ASD children and youth. For a comprehensive description of the procedure and measures, please see the main efficacy paper [@cheungRCT]. Participants were recruited from a community sample via flyers distributed in online parent groups and advocacy organizations (e.g. CHILD-BRIGHT Network). Informed consent was obtained from the caregivers, and assent was obtained from the children at the beginning of the study. Ethics approval was obtained through the SickKids Research Ethics Board. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, trial number NCT03502239.

## Intervention

<!-- added multi-image figure with cross reference below and linked in this paragraph -->

The Mega Team intervention trains response inhibition and working memory. There are four minigames in Mega Team. Two minigames are played on a laptop and two are played on a tablet. In the laptop minigames participants play as various superhero characters dodging obstacles and collecting gems to save other members of their superhero team (see [@fig-megateam]).
